- **Challenges**:
    - The scope of the project was really big and we literally had to burn the midnight oil to work and bring the project to fruition.
    - We faced a major problem using versioning with github as one of us merged their workk to the master branch prematurely
    we had to fix this by manually removing and adding files then finally pushing them all to the dev and main branches enabling us to have a working whole again.
    - We also faced a major issue pushing the code to vercel via the cli mainly because we were not pushing the    environment variables but once we learnt how to add the variable it still did not work as the next js build had an issue which was not so clear at first but it was because of how we managed server and client components.
    - We also faced a lot of issue with caching in next js as it automatically caches a all the data and outrightly it is not easy to know but we were able to overcome this problem by adding no-store to the fetch function.

- **Lessons Learned**: 
    - Proper planning and design is very important.

    - One that directus is a really awesome and cool CMS that can get a lot done.
